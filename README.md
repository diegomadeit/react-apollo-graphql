# React Apollo GraphQL

### Overview

In this project I combine [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) in order to fetch remote data from a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) endpoint.

### The project

The GraphQL endpoint provides some films from Christopher Nolan. With a filter all movies or only the Batman series movies are shown.

The GraphQL endpoint is added in a environment variable in a _.env_ file.

### Covered concepts

- Integrate Apollo Client in a React App.
- Experiment with GraphQL queries.
- [Add Custom Environment Variables.](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables)

### Run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Credits

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
